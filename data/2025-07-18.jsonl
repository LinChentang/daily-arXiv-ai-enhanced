In the other direction, we show that if there is no\nrequirement for the network to match any score function, then diffusion\nmodeling can simulate any Turing machine in a certain sense. This dichotomy\nprovides a theoretical lens on the capabilities and limitations of diffusion\nmodels, particularly concerning tasks requiring sequential computation. We\nconjecture extensions of our theoretical results, including for the case where\nthe diffusion model is not perfect, but merely good.

However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count).

However, in many papers neural\nnetworks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel\nor similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new\ndata which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training\nknowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be\ntime-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited\ncomputing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing\nresources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This\nmotivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform\nrobustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information\nbeing known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to\ngenerate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that\nafter training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error\n(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network\nsolutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for\nreal-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further\npropose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different\nchannel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks\nwith different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved\nappears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations,\nneural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both\nfixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads."}

Despite advances in\nmulti-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures\nthat effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different\nphysiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in\nmany biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional\nmethods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified\ndeep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across\ndifferent signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an\nattention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:\ntime-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to\ngenerate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase\nsignal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in\nthe best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps\nincluded wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class\nimbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced\ndata augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were\napplied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the\nproposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH\nArrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,\nand 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types\nand clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and\nprocesses each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on\nlow-end or wearable devices."}

Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive\nreviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural\nmodules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical,\ntheoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We\ndistinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and\nparameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated\nacross a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness,\nadaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module\ntends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers\ncapable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may\noffer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy\nefficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust\nembodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such\nsystems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are\nstill lacking.

To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel segmentation framework that leverages the\npower of vision foundation models (VFMs) through a parallel encoding\narchitecture. Specifically, a vision transformer (ViT) encoder within the VFM\ncaptures global structural features, enhanced by the activation of the final\ntwo ViT blocks and the integration of an attention-guided enhancement (AGE)\nmodule, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder extracts local\ndetails. These complementary features are adaptively fused using a cross-branch\nvariational fusion (CVF) module, which models latent distributions and applies\nvariational attention to assign modality-specific weights. Additionally, we\nintroduce an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module, which\nquantifies uncertainty using evidence theory and refines uncertain regions by\nincorporating multi-scale feature aggregation and attention mechanisms, further\nenhancing segmentation accuracy.

Weighting a partition according to the spanning-tree metric has\nbeen of mathematical and practical interest because it typically favors\npartitions with more compact pieces. An appealing algorithm suggested by\nCharikar et al. is to sample a random spanning tree and remove k-1 edges,\nproducing a random forest. If the components of the forest form a balanced\npartition, the partition is equitable under an easily computed acceptance\nprobability. Cannon et al. recently showed that spanning trees on grid graphs\nand grid-like graphs on $n$ vertices are splittable into $k$ equal sized pieces\nwith probability at least $n^{-2k}$, leading to the first rigorous sampling\nalgorithm for a class of graphs. We present complementary results showing that\nspanning trees on dense random graphs also have inverse polynomial probability\nof being splittable, giving another class of graphs where equitable partitions\ncan be efficiently sampled exactly. These proofs also guarantee fast\nalmost-uniform sampling for the up-down walk on forests, giving another\nprovably efficient randomized method for generating equitable partitions.\n  Further, we show that problems with the well-studied ReCom algorithm for\nequitable partitioning are more extensive than previously known, even in\nspecial cases that were believed to be more promising. We present a family of\ngraphs where the Markov chain fails to be irreducible when it must keep the\ncomponents perfectly equitable; yet when the chain is allowed an imbalance of\njust one vertex between components, the rejection sampling step may take\nexponential time. This is true even when the graph satisfies desirable\nproperties that have been conjectured to be sufficient for fast sampling."}

Accepted to ESA 2025", "summary": "A $k$-submodular function naturally generalizes submodular functions by\ntaking as input $k$ disjoint subsets, rather than a single subset. Unlike\nstandard submodular maximization, which only requires selecting elements for\nthe solution, $k$-submodular maximization adds the challenge of determining the\nsubset to which each selected element belongs. Prior research has shown that\nthe greedy algorithm is a 1/2-approximation for the monotone $k$-submodular\nmaximization problem under cardinality or matroid constraints. However, whether\na firm 1/2-approximation exists for the budgeted version (i.e., with a knapsack\nconstraint) has remained open for several years. We resolve this question\naffirmatively by proving that the 1-Guess Greedy algorithm, which first guesses\nan appropriate element from an optimal solution before proceeding with the\ngreedy algorithm, achieves a 1/2-approximation. This result is asymptotically\ntight as $((k+1)/(2k)+\\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many\nvalue oracle queries even without constraints (Iwata et al., SODA 2016). We\nfurther show that 1-Guess Greedy is 1/3-approximation for the non-monotone\nproblem. This algorithm is both simple and parallelizable, making it\nwell-suited for practical applications. Using the thresholding technique from\n(Badanidiyuru and Vondrak, SODA 2014), it runs in nearly $\\tilde O(n^2k^2)$\ntime.\n  The proof idea is simple: we introduce a novel continuous transformation from\nan optimal solution to a greedy solution, using the multilinear extension to\nevaluate every fractional solution during the transformation. This continuous\nanalysis approach yields two key extensions. First, it enables improved\napproximation ratios of various existing algorithms. Second, our method\nnaturally extends to $k$-submodular maximization problems under broader\nconstraints, offering a more flexible and unified analysis framework."}

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how\nto weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,\nhow to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with\ndecision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The\nmulti-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby\nproblems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights\nduring aggregation.

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration.

Copyright IEEE", "summary": "Traffic Movement Count (TMC) at intersections is crucial for optimizing\nsignal timings, assessing the performance of existing traffic control measures,\nand proposing efficient lane configurations to minimize delays, reduce\ncongestion, and promote safety. Traditionally, methods such as manual counting,\nloop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been\nused for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC\nestimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh\nweather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)\ntechnology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its\nexpanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This\npaper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a\ndual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC\nestimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to\nclassify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and\nvehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides\ninsights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements\nare also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also\ntrajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections."}

A\nseminal theorem of Hell and Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il asserts that the $H$-Coloring\nproblem is NP-hard whenever $H$ is loopless and non-bipartite. A result of\nJansen and Pieterse implies that for every graph $H$, the $H$-Coloring problem\nparameterized by the vertex cover number $k$ admits a kernel with\n$O(k^{\\Delta(H)})$ vertices and bit-size bounded by $O(k^{\\Delta(H)} \\cdot \\log\nk)$, where $\\Delta(H)$ denotes the maximum degree in $H$. For the case where\n$H$ is a complete graph on at least three vertices, this kernel size nearly\nmatches conditional lower bounds established by Jansen and Kratsch and by\nJansen and Pieterse.\n  This paper presents new upper and lower bounds on the kernel size of\n$H$-Coloring problems parameterized by the vertex cover number. The upper\nbounds arise from two kernelization algorithms. The first is purely\ncombinatorial, and its size is governed by a structural quantity of the graph\n$H$, called the non-adjacency witness number. As applications, we obtain\nkernels whose size is bounded by a fixed polynomial for natural classes of\ngraphs $H$ with unbounded maximum degree. More strikingly, we show that for\nalmost every graph $H$, the degree of the polynomial that bounds the size of\nour combinatorial kernel grows only logarithmically in $\\Delta(H)$. Our second\nkernel leverages linear-algebraic tools and involves the notion of faithful\nindependent representations of graphs. It strengthens the general bound from\nprior work and, among other applications, yields near-optimal kernels for\nproblems concerning the dimension of orthogonal graph representations over\nfinite fields. We complement these results with conditional lower bounds,\nthereby nearly settling the kernel complexity of the problem for various target\ngraphs $H$."}

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models.

To tackle these issues, we propose a\ncomprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive\ntemporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that\nutilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create\nhigh-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly\nenriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we\nconstruct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships\nthrough strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,\neffectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.\nFurthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture\ndiverse real-world driving risks.

Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates\ncause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK\nmatrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the\nunderlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for\na two-layer linear network.

To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios.

We argue that\nclassifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions\ncannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject\nlow-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector\nthat evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key\nchallenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to\ndesign a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we\nintroduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a\nsimple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to\nmirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER\noutperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject\nstrategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a\nnew human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future\nresearch."}

However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior.

Owing to\nCLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing\ninterest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on\ntask-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting\nin suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,\nwe propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and\nEnsemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the\nattention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain\nshifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated\ntarget domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the\nattention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE\nutilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant\nattention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive\nexperimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally\nachieves better results than state-of-the-art methods.

VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or\nmatches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency\nby 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different\nconditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the\nfirst MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual\nmanipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks."}

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process.

The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable\nfeature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers\nthe ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.\nSpecifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure\nrepresentation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to\ntransform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral\nunobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress\nthe unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space.

Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration.

Recent advances in\nvisual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and\ngeneralization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains\nlimited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a\nfeature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its\nsparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a\nsalient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,\nwe complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric\nfeatures, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a\ntransformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable\nprecise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior\ndetector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater\nrobustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy\nand generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone\nDINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on\nthe TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while\nrunning efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single\nGPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor\ndriving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities."}

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks.

This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified\ndeep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across\ndifferent signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an\nattention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:\ntime-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to\ngenerate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase\nsignal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in\nthe best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps\nincluded wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization.

Many computational-statistical tradeoffs have been shown under\naverage-case assumptions, but since statistical problems are average-case in\nnature, it has been a challenge to base them on standard worst-case\nassumptions.\n  In PAC learning where such tradeoffs were first studied, the question is\nwhether computational efficiency can come at the cost of using more samples\nthan information-theoretically necessary. We base such tradeoffs on\n$\\mathsf{NP}$-hardness and obtain:\n  $\\circ$ Sharp computational-statistical tradeoffs assuming $\\mathsf{NP}$\nrequires exponential time: For every polynomial $p(n)$, there is an $n$-variate\nclass $C$ with VC dimension $1$ such that the sample complexity of\ntime-efficiently learning $C$ is $\\Theta(p(n))$.\n  $\\circ$ A characterization of $\\mathsf{RP}$ vs. $\\mathsf{NP}$ in terms of\nlearning: $\\mathsf{RP} = \\mathsf{NP}$ iff every $\\mathsf{NP}$-enumerable class\nis learnable with $O(\\mathrm{VCdim}(C))$ samples in polynomial time.

Machine learning (ML) models have\nrecently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in\nresource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we\nreproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency\nlimit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates.
